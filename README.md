# Responsive navigation with Mega menu

## Larger Screens:

On larger screens, the navigation menu is horizontal, and a mega menu (sub-menu) appears beneath it.

---

## Smaller Devices:

- The navigation menu becomes a left sidebar that slides in.
- A header with a back button and the title of the currently open sub-menu is displayed.
- A close button is also available.

**Sub-Navigation (when open):**

- The back button is visible when the sub-navigation slides in.
- Clicking the back button closes the sub-navigation.

**Sub-Navigation (when open) and Main Navigation (when closed):**

- When the sub-navigation is open and the main navigation is closed, the sub-navigation remains open in its current state.
- The sub-navigation closes when a sub-navigation link is clicked.

**Main Navigation (when open):**

- An overlay appears when the main navigation is open.
- Clicking the overlay closes the main navigation.
